## Description
  The point of this project was to refactor a book search engine that used a RESTful API. The refactor is building the app to be GraphQL API built with an Apollo Server. The app was built with the MERN stack, a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. The issues refactoring an already functioning application can be very challenging.
